Simple blog crawler using node.js. Checks to see if there have been any new posts on 
select blogs since last time it was ran, and saves images to file from 
new blog entries. 
To run, type "node blogCrawler.js" into terminal.

Blog information can be found in bloginfo.json, and can be edited to search other blogs. 

I used to repost these images to tumblr, which gained me many followers.
